# Summary

DEFAULT METHODS IN INTERFACES
Concrete implemented methods can be written inside
interfaces from Java 8 by using default keyword
01
STATIC METHODS IN INTERFACES
Static methods can be written inside Interfaces from
Java 8 which can be leveraged to write lot of utility
logic inside them.
02
OPTIONAL TO DEAL WITH NULLS

logic
04
FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE

New Data & Time API (java.time.*) is introduced to overcome
the challenges with java.util.Date API and provided new
features as well
09

CompletableFuture is introduced focusing async and nonblocking programming in Java 8.

MAP ENHANCEMENTS
Multiple default and static methods are introduced
inside Map interface
11
